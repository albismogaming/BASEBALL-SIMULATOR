# Baseball-Simulator
This is my first plate appearance at making any sort of project in python ;) 

I chose the difficult task of creating a Baseball Simulator that will simulate an entire baseball game.

It is a fairly basic simulator, there isn't too much complexity like you would probably see from a game or an official simulator. 

This is still a work in progress and plan to keep updating the code so it runs more efficiently and can take in more complex functions.
